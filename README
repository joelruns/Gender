==========================

Thanks to OkCupid Scraper by Allen Majewski for base code

1. To scrape and gather data just run the following command. The script will scrape OkCupid for profiles and launch the classifier.

  $ ./scrape.sh

2. If you already have training and testing data and don't want to wait for scraping just go ahead and run the following command to start. Type "#quit" to escape the program once it starts asking for your commands.

  $ python classifier.py

3. If you want a list of ten sentences for each gender comparing against human performance just run the following command.

  $ python experiment.py

That's all folks enjoy.
